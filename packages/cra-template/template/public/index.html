      %BASE_HREF% is a placeholder, that is supposed to be replaced by the
      server-side renderer. %BASE_HREF% is determined during runtime and can be
      changed without recompiling making your compiled web app independent of
      a server / CDN location. The base tag specifies how to resolve relative
      URLs for CSS files, favicon, etc (notice the trailing slash in the href
      attribute). Therefore, using %BASE_HREF% only makes sense if all other URL
      references are kept relative. Alternatively, you can delete the base tag
      and use %PUBLIC_URL% as documented by create-react-app.

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
